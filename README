Please use the version of this driver that is in the Linux kernel main
tree in the drivers/platform/x86/ directory.  It is the latest version,
and includes all of the needed fixes and supports a wider range of
devices than this one does.

This repo is just the old history of how the driver was developed
originally, and is not to be run by anyone on any machines anymore.

If anyone has questions about this, please contact me:
